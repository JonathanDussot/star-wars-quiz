# Star Wars Quiz

## Project Overview

Star Wars Quiz is an online quiz with the aim of attracting and testing fans' knowledge of the Star Wars universe.  It facilitates users with the possibility to choose the level of difficulty and find more challenging questions about the topic they are so passionate about.

This website aims to appeal to fans of all ages as it includes questions in regard to content seen within all the films throughout the Star Wars saga. It also should aim to generate some interest as to the overall backstory of each character as well as the main plot itself.

## Design

### colour scheme

I designed the colour palette for the website myself. I only used [colormind.io](http://colormind.io/) to display the color palette of primary colours used.  Here is the list of colours used:

- #111111, #333333, #dddddd, #eeeeee 

  - These colours were quite basic shades between black, grey and white.  The reason being for this is that it suited the theme of _Star Wars_ perfectly, as I gave each colour a certain degree of transparency depending on the element it was used on, so that the background image of outerspace, which also happens to be black and white, can be fully appreciated at all times.

- #3333ff, #00c00, #cc0000

  - These are secondary colours found throughout the page specifically in the button elements.  The first colour is used as an active effect for the the user has clicked on an option, where as the second and third colour indicate whether an answer is right or wrong, respectively.

### Typography

I used Google Fonts to import the following:

- 'Libre Franklin' is a sans-serif style which I chose due to its close resemblance to the font used within _Star Wars_ to help give it a slightly familiar vibe to the quiz participants.

### Imagery

All the images added to the quiz are related to the franchise.  The background image has the purpose of setting the theme of the quiz, while more specific images within the body such as Yoda in the instructions and the villains within the game-difficulty buttons are set to give the user somewhat of a role as they start the quiz. The sources of each image used can be verified in the credit section below.

### Wireframes

I created these wireframes using Balsamiq.

#### Home Page

This is the home page with the instructions.  Some minor changes were made in terms of the buttons available to start running the quiz.
